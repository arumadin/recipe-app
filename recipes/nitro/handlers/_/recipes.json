Cool in pan 5 minutes, then turn cupcakes out onto wire rack to completely cool.</li><li>PEANUT-BUTTER FILLING:  In small bowl, combine all ingredients.  Core cooled cupcakes with a Cuisipro or other hollowing device, and fill cavity with peanut butter filling.  Eat the cupcake pieces you cored; sandwich two with some peanut butter filling and marshmallow frosting.</li><li>MARSHMALLOW FROSTING:  In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, bring water, corn syrup and 1/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp. sugar to a rolling boil on high heat, brushing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush.  Do not stir mixture, as it will cause it to crystallize.  Boil until mixture reaches 242F, or soft-ball stage.</li><li>In the meantime, a few minutes after the sugar mixture comes to a boil, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl.  Using regular beaters on medium-high speed whip egg whites, vanilla powder or extract, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes.  With mixer still on, sprinkle the remaining 1 Tbsp. of sugar over the whites and continue beating until whites hold very soft peaks, another 2 minutes.  When syrup has reached 242F, reduce mixer speed to low.  Find the sweet spot (between the sides of the bowl and the beaters) and very, very slowly and carefully drizzle in the hot syrup.  After all syrup has been added, turn mixer to high and beat till thick, fluffy and just barely warm, about 7 minutes.  Fit a 16\" piping bag with a 1M Wilton tip; spoon frosting into bag and pipe onto cupcakes making high mounds of frosting.</li><li>GARNISHES:  Place chocolate into one bottom corner of a resealable plastic bag.  Microwave on high about 30 seconds.  Continue microwaving on high at 10-second intervals until chocolate is melted.  Very carefully cut the tiniest corner to make a very small hole through which the chocolate may be drizzled onto the frosting.  Lightly sprinkle peanuts over cupcakes.</li><li>TIME-SAVING TIPS:  Instead of making peanut butter filling, just use Peanut Butter & Co.'s White Chocolate Wonderful Peanut Butter.  If you're not lactose intolerant, you could use a cake mix for the cupcakes, but you will have to double the other ingredients.</li></ol>","dishTypes":["dessert"],"extendedIngredients":[{"name":"baking powder","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","image":"white-powder.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps"},"metric":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps"}}},{"name":"baking soda","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","image":"white-powder.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps"},"metric":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps"}}},{"name":"bittersweet chocolate","amount":1,"unit":"oz","image":"dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"oz"},"metric":{"amount":28.35,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"canola oil","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":112,"unitShort":"ml"}}},{"name":"chocolate flavor","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","image":"milk-chocolate.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp"}}},{"name":"freshly coffee","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","image":"brewed-coffee.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":118.5,"unitShort":"ml"}}},{"name":"corn syrup","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","image":"corn-syrup.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":170.5,"unitShort":"ml"}}},{"name":"cream of tartar","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","image":"white-powder.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"pinch"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"pinch"}}},{"name":"jif natural creamy peanut butter","amount":7,"unit":"Tbsp","image":"peanut-butter.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":7,"unitShort":"Tbsps"},"metric":{"amount":7,"unitShort":"Tbsps"}}},{"name":"dutch cocoa powder","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","image":"cocoa-powder.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":43,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"egg","amount":1,"unit":"large","image":"egg.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"large"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"large"}}},{"name":"egg whites","amount":2,"unit":"large","image":"egg-white.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"large"},"metric":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"large"}}},{"name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.33333334,"unit":"cup","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.33333334,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":66.667,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"granulated sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":100,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"brown sugar","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":55,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"maple syrup","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","image":"maple-syrup.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":80.5,"unitShort":"ml"}}},{"name":"honey-roasted peanuts","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","image":"peanuts.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":36.5,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"salt","amount":0.25,"unit":"tsp","image":"salt.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"tsps"},"metric":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"tsps"}}},{"name":"salt","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","image":"salt.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"pinch"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"pinch"}}},{"name":"soy milk","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","image":"soy-milk.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":118,"unitShort":"ml"}}},{"name":"soy milk","amount":1,"unit":"Tbsp","image":"soy-milk.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp"}}},{"name":"confectioner's sugar","amount":2,"unit":"Tbsp","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"Tbsps"},"metric":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"Tbsps"}}},{"name":"unbleached flour","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","image":"flour.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":1.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":187.5,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"vanilla extract","amount":0.5,"unit":"tsp","image":"vanilla-extract.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps"},"metric":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps"}}},{"name":"vanilla extract","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","image":"vanilla-extract.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp"}}},{"name":"water","amount":3,"unit":"Tbsp","image":"water.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"Tbsps"},"metric":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"Tbsps"}}}],"analyzedInstructions":[{"steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 350F.

Remix your egg mixture (pepper and flour may settle a bit) and pour over your broccoli mixture.\nTake your remaining phyllo sheets and put on top 2 layers at a time coating with butter in between. Roll your over hanging edges with the phyllo sides to create a 'crust edge'. Brush top with butter.\nBake in 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Remove any string-like particles from the chili pods. Add them to the boiling water along with half of a packet of Goya seasoning. Cover and let boil for about 20 minutes.\nAfterwards, place chili pods with 2 cups of the stock in a blender to coalesce. Drain the saucepan of the remaining stock and place back on the stove top. Return the heat to medium, and add olive oil once the remaining stock evaporates.\nAdd onion and beef, and immediately begin to break apart the beef. Add 1 packet of Goya seasoning and chili powder, and allow to cook for 5 minutes. Add the chili sauce and cook an additional 5 minutes. Add garlic and 2 teaspoon salt. I added the poblano pepper at this point, but I should have added it with the beef and onion.\nReduce heat to medium-low, and cook for one hour. For the last twenty minutes, partially cover the pan in order to slightly reduce. Most of the liquid should be reduced and thickened.\nIn a large bowl, add instant corn masa mix, water, baking powder, salt, and olive oil to create corn masa mix. The mixture should be spongy.\nWhats surprisingly tricky is assembling the tamales. The best technique Ive found is to thinly spread the tamale masa mix starting from the right-hand side of the corn husks, and leaving about 2 inches on the left-hand side of the husk. When rolling the tamale together, take the right-hand side and fold it onto the rest of the corn husk covered with tamale masa mix. The 1-2 inches left over should roll perfectly over the actual tamale. Dont overstuff the tamales! Id say 2 tablespoon of meat mixture and just a sparse amount of cheese.\nO cook, you should have a double boiler. If you dont, like me, then use a metal colander and place it in a large pot. Place the tamales in the colander (or double boiler) where they are not squished, nor are they loose enough to unravel themselves. While doing this, boil 2 cups of water in the pot or what equates to 1 inch in height of the water.\nOnce water comes to a boil, reduce heat and add the tamales. Place a towel between the colander and lid, and cook for 30 minutes.","dishTypes":["lunch","main course","main dish","dinner"],"extendedIngredients":[{"name":"corn husks","amount":20,"unit":"","image":"corn-husks.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":20,"unitShort":""},"metric":{"amount":20,"unitShort":""}}},{"name":"california chili pods","amount":6,"unit":"","image":"dried-arbol-chiles.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":6,"unitShort":""},"metric":{"amount":6,"unitShort":""}}},{"name":"ground beef","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","image":"fresh-ground-beef.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1.5,"unitShort":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":337.5,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"mozzarella cheese","amount":1,"unit":"cup","image":"shredded-cheese-white.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"cup"},"metric":{"amount":112,"unitShort":"g"}}},{"name":"poblano pepper","amount":0.5,"unit":"","image":"poblano-peppers.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":""},"metric":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":""}}},{"name":"garlic","amount":4,"unit":"cloves","image":"garlic.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":4,"unitShort":"cloves"},"metric":{"amount":4,"unitShort":"cloves"}}},{"name":"olive oil","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","image":"olive-oil.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"Tbsps"},"metric":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"Tbsps"}}},{"name":"goya seasoning","amount":1.5,"unit":"packets","image":"seasoning.png","measures":{"us":{"amount":1.5,"unitShort":"packets"},"metric":{"amount":1.5,"unitShort":"packets"}}},{"name":"salt","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","image":"salt.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"tsps"},"metric":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"tsps"}}},{"name":"chili powder","amount":1,"unit":"teaspoon","image":"chili-powder.jpg","measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp"}}}],"analyzedInstructions":[{"steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, allow corn husks to soak in hot water.

I like mine to still have a few chickpeas and pieces of kale through it so I set aside a couple of ladlefuls and used a stick blender to blitz the rest."},{"number":6,"step":"Serve hot, floating a couple of slices of lemon on top of each serving and pass round the parmesan cheese for everyone to help themselves.
